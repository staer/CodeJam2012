Google Code Jam 2012
====================

These are my entries for the Google Code Jam 2012 contest. I decided to fool around with this at the last minute and probably won't make it past the first round. That being said here are my solutions to whatever problems I attempt to solve.

All of these solutions were developed in Python 2.7.2 and executed in [Pypy 1.8](http://pypy.org).

For more information about the Google Code Jam see the contest website at: [http://code.google.com/codejam](http://code.google.com/codejam). My entries are submitted under the contestant name "Staer".
